2. INTELLIGENT FIT SCORING & QUALIFICATION

Influence Score (0-100): Assesses decision-making power based on seniority level, role scope, company size, authority indicators, experience level, and career progression.

Role Mapping: Classifies prospects as Buyer (decision-maker), Strong Influencer (key stakeholder), Champion (internal advocate), or Not Ideal (poor fit).

Shared Context Score (0-100): Quantifies personal connection strength. Identifies educational connections (same schools), professional connections (same companies), geographic overlaps, industry connections, and mutual connections. This context is automatically woven into messages to create stronger connections.

4. COMPANY RESEARCH & INTELLIGENCE

Performs intelligent research on companies from prospect's work history: company background and positioning, size and growth trajectory, relevance to offering, buying signals from context, industry trends, and how prospect's role relates to potential need.

5. POST & ACTIVITY ANALYSIS

Analyzes recent LinkedIn activity to extract: key topics and subjects, professional focus areas, pain points mentioned, buying signals and initiative hints, outreach hooks from specific posts, conversation starters, engagement patterns, and industry trends discussed.

6. PERSONALIZED MESSAGE GENERATION

Connection Request: Personalized LinkedIn requests referencing shared context, specific posts, professional focus, respecting Premium status (200/400 char limits), with appropriate tone based on risk level.

Cold Email: Professional emails with compelling subject lines, company research references, pain point addressing, relevant offer presentation, clear call-to-action, and professional tone.

8. TRANSPARENCY & GUIDANCE

Confidence indicators, signals used list, "Do Say" guidelines, and "Don't Say" warnings help users understand reasoning and make informed decisions.

9. RELATED PROSPECTS DISCOVERY

Analyzes "People also viewed" profiles to identify similar prospects, score relevance, provide fit reasons, assess decision power, and enable easy navigation to alternatives.

10. REGENERATION CAPABILITY

After initial analysis, regenerate messages with different parameters without re-analyzing: change risk level, switch offer types, adjust strategy, fast iteration for A/B testing, cost-effective refinement.

11. CONTENT COPILOT – CREATE CONTENT OR WRITE COMMENTS

The Content product clearly offers two modes:

Create content: Set a content goal and target audience (ICP); get inspiration by analyzing profiles’ posts; generate LinkedIn posts, articles, carousels, video scripts, and polls with tone customization; manage a content library and history.

Write comments: On any LinkedIn feed or post page, analyze multiple visible posts in one go. For each post, get (a) a short summary, (b) whether it makes sense to comment (yes/no) with a reason tied to your outreach goal and ICP, and (c) a suggested comment you can copy. Uses your Marketing Compose settings (goal, offer, ICP) so suggestions stay on-brand. Supports DOM extraction of posts or AI parsing from page text when needed.
